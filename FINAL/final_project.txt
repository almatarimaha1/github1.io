hey mrs. tanzosh...

I had a lot of trouble trying to follow the steps, I tried updating the link but
I couldn't figure out how. I'm missing something that's so easy I know. I hope
me sending you the "updated" link above will do for now. I understand if you take off
points I deserve it! :) I'll have someone help me (when they wake up)
Have a great night.
